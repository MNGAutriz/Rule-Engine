# Purchase Calculation Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing calculationMethod in Rules
**Problem**: Several rules were missing the `calculationMethod` property, causing them to fall back to the `calculateSimpleReward` method instead of using the proper calculation helpers.

**Fixed Rules**:
- âœ… **HK/TW Base Purchase Points**: Added `calculationMethod: "base"`
- âœ… **HK/TW Campaign Bonus**: Added `calculationMethod: "fixed"`  
- âœ… **JP Campaign Multiplier**: Added `calculationMethod: "multiplier"`
- âœ… **Redemption Rule**: Added `calculationMethod: "redemption"`
- âœ… **Adjustment Rule**: Added `calculationMethod: "adjustment"`

### 2. Purchase Rate Calculations
**Verified Correct Rates**:
- ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ **Japan (JP)**: 1 MD = 10 JPY (conversionRate: 0.1) âœ…
- ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡° **Hong Kong (HK)**: 1 MD = 1 HKD (standardRate: 1.0) âœ…  
- ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ **Taiwan (TW)**: 1 MD = 1 TWD (standardRate: 1.0) âœ…

### 3. Event Type Processing
**All Event Types Now Working**:
- âœ… **RECYCLE**: Awards points based on recycled bottles (3 bottles Ã— 50 = 150 MD)
- âœ… **CONSULTATION**: Awards consultation bonus (75 MD)
- âœ… **REDEMPTION**: Properly deducts points (-100 MD) 
- âœ… **ADJUSTMENT**: Awards manual adjustment points (+100 MD)
- âœ… **PURCHASE**: Correct market-specific calculations

### 4. Validation Fixes
**Fixed Validation Issues**:
